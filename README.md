# Wireless Cellular Simulator for Radio Resource Management

## Running HetNet Simulation

run `sim_hetnet_run`

Results are obtained in output folder

Plotting is perfomed with `ua_plot_results_rb_ua_algo_compare`

## Hints 

In order to remove FolderName from remote repository and keep the local version :

	git rm -r --cached FolderName
	git commit -m "Removed folder from repository"
	git push origin master

A good tutorial from contributing to someone's repository is available [here](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html).

## Todo

Evaluate SINR for simulated algorithms (RB allocation + user association)
